                If coding is a hobby and you have 
                some ideas of what you want to create then go ahead and create them.
                Software and hosting is free and there are some great free online 
                coding courses to help you learn. It doesnâ€™t cost anything except time.

            <h1 class="heading">Fiction books</h1>
            <p>
                One of the reasons why reading is the best hobby is
                 because it expands your horizons. It gives you something
                  new and different to enjoy. And there are so many diverse subjects
                 that you can read about that you are learning something every time that you read.
                  You can learn practically anything from reading a good book on the subject. Even if you
                 choose to read fiction, you may learn something that is helpful in your life.

            <p>
                Football is not only my hobby but also help me improve my health.
                 Playing football helps me increase muscle and bone strength,
                 reduce body fat and improve my health due to shift between walking, running and sprinting.
                 Football will build my leg strength and increase my concentration span.
